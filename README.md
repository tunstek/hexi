# hexi
Hexi is a generic motion simulator. Developed as my graduation project ([thesis PDF in Chinese](./resources/thesis.pdf)).

[Video demo on Youtube](https://youtu.be/wAmHUI8TY4Q)

## Features

- Generic: can meet demands by developing plugins.
- Supports Microsoft Flight Simulator X as an input signal source.
- Implements the classical washout algorithm.
- Supports visualizing simulation performance via a 3D Stewart GUI.

## !! Notice !!

There are no hardware supports due to my limited money & time during the research. However a real-time 3D visualization is available as described above.

Feel free to write output plugins to support a specific hardware and send me PRs!

## Alternatives & Comparison

Similar softwares are [X-Sim](http://www.x-sim.de/forum/portal.php) and [XSimulator](https://www.xsimulator.net/). However this project has the following advantages:

- Open-source & free of charge.
- Cross platform: Windows, Linux, MacOS.
- A greater plug-in system (more extensible).
- Using modern technologies.
- Possible better motion cueing performance (?).

## Possible Use of This Project

- Refer to the software implemention the classical washout algorithm, especially the HP/LP filters (in Python).
- Refer to the approach to connect to FSX (in .NET).
- Refer to the design and implementation of a extensible system (via plug-in mechanism).
- Refer to the implementation of rendering a 3D Stewart platform (via WebGL).
- Refer to the implementation of a TCP + UDP high performance async data channel (in Python).
- See how motion simulation really works!
- Design and test new motion cueing algorithms.
- Real-life motion simulation (if you can develop a hardware output plugin).

## Prerequisites

- [Python 3.6 or above](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Nodejs 6.0 or above](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Getting Started from Source

This repository does not contain 3rd-party dependencies and prebuilt files. In order to start the platform from this repository, you need to build the project as described below.

> Note: These steps are written for Linux/MacOS users. For Windows users, you may need to adjust commands a little, mainly the formats of directories.

First, you need to install dependencies:

```bash
# in the project's root directory:
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install   # or: cnpm install
```

> You may need to use [cnpm](https://npm.taobao.org/) instead of npm if you are in China. To avoid compatibility issues, be sure to use cnpm by creating `alias` as described in its homepage instead of the default way.

Next, you need to compile the user interface for core modules and plugins:

```bash
# in the project's root directory:
npm run build:coreDll
npm run build:core
npm run build:plugin -- --env.pluginName input_flight_attitude
npm run build:plugin -- --env.pluginName input_fsx
npm run build:plugin -- --env.pluginName mca_classical_washout
npm run build:plugin -- --env.pluginName output_stewart_visualize
```

In addition, the OutputStewartVisualize plugin needs extra build steps:

```bash
# in the project's root directory:
cd hexi/plugins/output_stewart_visualize
npm start
```

Now start a mongodb instance:
```bash
docker run --name mongodb -v mongodata:/data/db -d -p 27017:27017 mongo
```

Finally, you can start the Hexi server now:

```bash
# in the project's root directory:
python3 -m hexi.server
```

## For Developers

This section is for developers who wish to modify the source code or write new plugins for Hexi.

### Core User Interface

If you have modified the core user interface, you need to re-compile them to take effect:

```bash
# in the project's root directory:
npm run build:coreDll
npm run build:core
```

Alternatively, you may want to enable the watch mode so that they are recompiled automatically once you have made changes:

```bash
# in the project's root directory:
npm run build:core -- --watch
```

### Plugin User Interface

After modifying the plugin user interface, re-compile is required as well:

```bash
# in the project's root directory:
npm run build:plugin -- --env.pluginName PLUGIN_NAME
```

Alternatively, you can also enable watch mode here:

```bash
# in the project's root directory:
npm run build:plugin -- --env.pluginName PLUGIN_NAME --watch
```
